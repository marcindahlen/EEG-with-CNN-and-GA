### Classifying  people into groups is defined by [Raven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices), [IVE*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysfunctional_impulsivity), [CISS](https://psychology.wikia.org/wiki/Coping_Inventory_for_Stressful_Situations) psychometric tests based on individual's [electroencephalography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroencephalography) readings.

This repository is to investigate the possibility of using [convolutional neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) to classify EEG reading to one of defined bucket of psychological test's outcomes.
Part of the hypothesis is that training the network using genetic algorithm will provide better accuracy.

To evaluate the above, the developed python scripts will also use other available machine learning algorithms to compare with the considered one.
